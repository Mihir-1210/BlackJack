# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack game, a simple implementation of the classic card game in Python. This project simulates the Blackjack game where the player competes against the dealer.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
- The player can hit, stand, or double down.
- The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack.
- Basic card deck handling, including shuffling and dealing.
- Keeps track of the player's and dealer's score.
- Displays the current status of the game, such as player hand, dealer hand, and scores.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the program to begin playing.
2. **Player's Turn**: 
   - The player will be dealt two cards, and the dealer will be dealt one card face up and one face down.
   - The player can choose to "Hit" to get another card or "Stand" to hold their current hand.
   - The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
3. **Dealer's Turn**: After the player stands, the dealer will reveal their second card and play their turn, following the rules (dealer must hit if their score is below 17).
4. **End of Game**: The game ends when the player chooses to stand or goes bust (over 21). The winner is determined based on whose hand is closest to 21.
